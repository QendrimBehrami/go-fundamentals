# Go Fundamentals

A comprehensive collection of Go programming exercises and examples designed to cover most fundamental aspects of the Go programming language. This is a personal learning project that will eventually include extensive examples and exercises covering the core concepts of Go.

## Project Structure

- `hello-world/` - Basic Hello World program with multi-language support
- *(More modules will be added as the project progresses)*

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24.5 or later
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/QendrimBehrami/go-fundamentals.git
cd go-fundamentals
```

2. Run the hello-world example:
```bash
cd hello-world
go run hello.go
```

### Running Tests

To run all tests in the project:
```bash
go test ./...
```

To run tests for a specific package:
```bash
cd hello-world
go test
```

To run tests with verbose output:
```bash
go test -v
```

## Examples

### Hello World

The hello-world example demonstrates:
- Basic function creation
- String manipulation
- Multi-language greetings (English, Spanish, French)
- Test-driven development with Go

```go
// Example usage
fmt.Println(Hello("Chris", "English"))   // Output: Hello, Chris
fmt.Println(Hello("Elodie", "Spanish"))  // Output: Hola, Elodie
fmt.Println(Hello("Louis", "French"))    // Output: Bonjour, Louis
```

## Learning Goals

This project aims to cover comprehensive Go fundamentals including:

**Currently Implemented:**
- Package structure and imports
- Functions and return values
- Constants and variables
- Control structures (switch statements)
- Testing with the `testing` package
- Test-driven development (TDD)

**Planned Topics:**
- Variables, constants, and basic data types
- Arrays, slices, and maps
- Structs and methods
- Interfaces and polymorphism
- Pointers and memory management
- Error handling patterns
- Goroutines and concurrency
- Channels and communication
- File I/O operations
- JSON handling
- HTTP client/server programming
- Database interactions
- Package organization and modules
- Build tags and compilation
- Benchmarking and profiling

## Progress
